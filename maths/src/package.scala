/**
  * KSE Maths provides a variety of mathematical utilities that ought to be standard
  * but which go beyond standard high-school level algebra and trigonometry.
  * 
  * These include special functions, unsigned numbers, vectors, hashing and random
  * number generation, and safe and convenient temporal mathematics.
  * 
  * This package is not properly documented presently, however, though it is close
  * to complete in functionality (it is still missing some statistical methods and
  * function approximation and fitting routines).
